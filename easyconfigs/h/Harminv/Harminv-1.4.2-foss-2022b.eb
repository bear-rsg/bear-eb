description = """Harminv is a free program (and accompanying library) to solve the problem of harmonic inversion -
 given a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists of a sum of finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially
 decaying) in a given bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those
 sinusoids."""
